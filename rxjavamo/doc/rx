01. Observable::::::::::::

An Observable is a Producer of multiple values, "pushing" them to Observers (Consumers).
 this pattern faicilitates concurrent operations because it does not need to block while waiting for the Observable to emit objects,
 but instead it creates a sentry in the form of an observer that stands ready to react appropriately at whatever
  future time the Observable does so.
