Presentation layer:::

This layer contains the user interface (UI) elements, such as activities, fragments, and view models.
It also contains the business logic that is used to interact with the user.
The presentation layer depends on the domain layer and uses its entities and use cases.

Domain layer:::
This layer contains the core business logic of the application. It does not depend on any other layers, and it can be used in other applications.
The domain layer defines the entities and the use cases that are used by the presentation layer.
